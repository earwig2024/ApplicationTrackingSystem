added nav and footer html files
added scripts folder 
added php folder
added the 'scriptForPhpFiles' without including the code related to the navbar
    and footer. This is because whenever the PHP page is displayed, an alert 
    windowalways pops up

script.jsï¼š
Because the validation for greenriver.edu needs work, I have commented it out 
for now

signin and contact pages' email type is 'text' for me to test my code.
